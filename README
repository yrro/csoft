csoft - send SMS messages with csoft.co.uk
==========================================
Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>

'csoft' is a Python package that interfaces with the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS[Short Message Service] (SMS) delivery service
provided by http://www.csoft.co.uk/[Connection Software].

Two executable scripts are included:

 * `csoft-sms`, which sends a message to the phone number provided as the first
    command-line argument.

 * `check_csoft_messages`, a http://www.nagios.org/[Nagios] plugin that
    monitors the number of messages left in your account.

The scripts look for your username and PIN in the `Username` and `PIN`
environment variables.

Downloads
---------
Releases of 'csoft' can be downloaded from
http://robots.org.uk/src/csoft/releases/[].

Requirements
------------
 * http://www.python.org/[Python]. I develop and run with version 2.4, but
   earlier versions should also work.

 * http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/[Zolera SOAP Infrastructure] (ZSI) package.

 * http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto[M2Crypto] package.

Bugs and Limitations
--------------------
The scripts are basically functional but need polishing, which I will do before
the initial (0.1) release.
